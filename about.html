    <h1>About SurvivorMeter</h1>

    <p>SurvivorMeter is a light-hearted web experience built to simulate your survival chances in a fictional apocalypse. It mixes humor, personality profiling, and a pinch of nonsense.</p>

    <ul style="text-align: left; margin-top: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Entertain users with a fun quiz that estimates their survival profile during a hypothetical end-of-the-world scenario.</li>
      <li><strong>How it works:</strong> You answer a few absurd multiple-choice questions. Based on your responses, a "dominant trait" is identified, and a survival time is assigned—no real data or AI modeling involved. Just vibes.</li>
      <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No backend. No tracking. No cookies. No nonsense.</li>
      <li><strong>Creator:</strong> A solo indie dev with a passion for design, satire, and making people smile… even during zombie invasions.</li>
      <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> We believe the internet needs more fun, less fear. SurvivorMeter exists purely to brighten your day with a fictional score and a laugh.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">No apocalypse was harmed in the making of this app. All survival predictions are completely fictional and not intended for actual emergency planning (please don’t base your escape strategy on this).</p>
